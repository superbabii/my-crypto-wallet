## Introduction[![](assets/pin.svg)](#introduction)

My Crypto Wallet is a multi-chain cryptocurrency wallet built with React Native. This robust mobile application offers a comprehensive suite of features for managing digital assets across multiple blockchains, with a current focus on Ethereum and Solana networks.

### Key Features:
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Seamlessly manage Ethereum and Solana assets within a single, user-friendly interface.
- **Wallet Management**: Create new wallets, import existing ones, and manage multiple accounts with ease.
- **Transaction Handling**: Send, receive, and track transactions across supported blockchains.
- **Balance and Portfolio Tracking**: View real-time balances and monitor your overall crypto portfolio.
- **Security**: Implements encryption and secure storage techniques to protect your digital assets.
- **QR Code Integration**: Simplify address sharing and transaction processes with built-in QR code functionality.

Leveraging the power of Expo framework and Alchemy API, My Crypto Wallet provides a smooth, responsive user experience while ensuring reliable blockchain interactions. Whether you're a crypto enthusiast or a developer looking to explore mobile wallet implementation, My Crypto Wallet offers a feature-rich platform for managing digital currencies.

### Testnet-Only Application
**Important**: My Crypto Wallet is currently designed for use with the Ethereum Sepolia testnet and Solana Devnet only. It is not intended for use with real cryptocurrencies or on mainnet networks. This testnet focus allows for safe experimentation and development without risking actual digital assets.

#### Testnet Resources:
- **Ethereum (Sepolia Testnet)**: Obtain free test ETH from the [Sepolia Faucet](https://www.infura.io/faucet/sepolia).
- **Solana (Devnet)**: Acquire free test SOL from the [Solana Devnet Faucet](https://faucet.solana.com/).

### Development Focus
My Crypto Wallet serves as both a functional crypto wallet and a showcase of modern mobile development practices. It demonstrates the integration of blockchain technologies with React Native, emphasizing clean code architecture, robust state management with Redux, and a strong focus on security.

As I continue to evolve My Crypto Wallet, I'm committed to expanding its capabilities, enhancing security features, and potentially supporting additional blockchain networks in the future. This project represents my ongoing effort to create a robust, user-friendly cryptocurrency wallet that adapts to the ever-changing landscape of blockchain technology.

### Security

#### Encryption and Secure Storage
- **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**: Utilizes AES encryption, the gold standard in symmetric cryptography, to secure sensitive data.
- **Secure Local Storage**: Leverages React Native's `SecureStore` module, which uses Keychain Services on iOS and KeyStore on Android, providing OS-level security for stored data.

#### Cryptographic Best Practices
- **Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2)**:
  - Implements PBKDF2 for key derivation, significantly increasing resistance to brute-force attacks.
- **Salted Hashes**: Employs unique salts for each encryption operation, preventing rainbow table attacks and enhancing overall security.

#### Key Security
- **Unique Key Generation**: Implements a secure system for generating and storing unique encryption keys for each user, significantly enhancing the protection of sensitive data.
- **Advanced Key Derivation**: Utilizes key derivation functions to ensure that each user's encryption key is both strong and unique.

#### Wallet Security
- **Non-Custodial Design**: Users maintain full control of their private keys, which are never transmitted or stored unencrypted.
- **Mnemonic Phrase Protection**: Recovery phrases are encrypted before storage, ensuring they remain secure even if the device is compromised.

#### Code-Level Security Measures
- **Type Safety**: Utilizes TypeScript to prevent common programming errors and enhance code reliability.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Cryptographic operations are isolated in dedicated modules, facilitating code audits and reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities.
- **Error Handling**: Implements comprehensive error handling to prevent information leakage through error messages.

#### Future Security Enhancements (In Development)
- **Biometric Authentication**: Plans to integrate fingerprint and face recognition for an additional layer of security.
- **Secure Enclave Integration**: Future updates aim to leverage hardware-based key storage on supported devices for enhanced private key protection.
- **Transaction Signing**: Upcoming feature to allow offline transaction signing, further securing the transaction process.

#### Security Considerations for Users
- **Testnet Focus**: Currently designed for testnet use only. Users are advised against using real cryptocurrency with this wallet until a full security audit is completed.
- **Regular Updates**: The development team is committed to regular security updates and patch releases to address any discovered vulnerabilities promptly.
